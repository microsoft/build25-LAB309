# Build Lab 309 sample app

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/jeffreyca/azd-compose-search-demo.

Simple RAG app showcasing [azd's composability feature](https://aka.ms/azd-compose), which lets users progressively compose the Azure resources required for their app without manually writing Bicep. Uses Azure OpenAI or Foundry models, Azure Container Apps, and Azure AI Search (non-vector index).
