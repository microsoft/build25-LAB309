# Exercise 4: Configure monitoring and diagnostic tools

> [!Note]
> Goal: Configure and optimize your application running on Auzre.

In this module, we'll configure monitoring and diagnostic tools and work with the GitHub Copilot for Azure for cost optimization.

## Application monitoring overview
- performance, error logging, usage, etc
- cover Azure Monitor and Application Insights

Ask @azure agent "Help me set up monitoring on my application."

## Setting up monitoring

## Explore monitoring data

## Review

## Bonus challenge
[TODO: add two short bonus challenges]

## Congratulations!
You started with a basic Python application that had no functionality, you deployed it to Azure and got it running, then added AI Search and AI Chat, and did additional configurations so your applications is running smoothly on Azure.

## Next
We've added bonus challenges throughout the lab modules so that you can go back through and try your new knowledge if you didn't get a chance to do it in the live lab.
