# Exercise 4: Monitor your application and manage your storage account

> [!Note]
> Goal: Check logs in your Log Analytics Workspace and perform data plane operations on your storage account

## Module overview

In [Exercise-3](/Lab-Instructions/3.exercise-ai-chat.md), you used `azd add` to add Azure Open AI so that you can learn how your chat result is affected when you add grouding data to chat.

In this module, you are going to use GitHub Copilot for Azure to understand the logging setting on your application, review monitoring data, and perform data plane operations on your storage account. 

Time to complete: 15 minutes

## Checking logging settings 

Let's first check if logging has been properly set up for the project. If you closed the chat pane, click the GitHub Copilot icon in the top command bar again or use the shortcut **Ctrl + Alt + I** to open the chat pane. Use the following prompt in GitHub Copilot **Agent mode** to check your logging configurations. For consistent results across participants, please use Claude 3.7 Sonnet as your model.   

`Prompt: Do I have logging enabled for my project?`

This prompt will yield results after thoroughly checking the files in your workspace. 

### Bonus challenge - Use GitHub Copilot for Azure to find answers to these questions. The answers can be found in the end of this module. 
1. What's the name of the bicep module that sets up Azure Monitor including Log Analytics and Application Insights?
2. Name at least 2 access points for your application logs.
3. How can you enhance the logging setup? 

## Explore monitoring data
Now, let's use the following prompt to identify the name of your Log Analytics Workspace.

`Prompt: Identify the Log Analytics Workspace being used in my subscription` 

Once you have the name of your Log Analytics Workspace, try the following up with the prompt to generate a portal link to the workspace. 

`Prompt: Great! can you give me a portal link to the workspace?`

Try opening the link to confirm it works.

## Perform data plane operations on your storage account 

First, identify your storage account using the following prompt in agent mode. 

`Prompt: List all the storage accounts in my current subscription`

Then, in the same chat, use the following prompt to get the list of blob containers. 

`Prompt: List all blob containers in my storage account` 

Add a new blob container to your storage account for media content. 

`Prompt: Add a new blob container named "media" in my storage account using Azure CLI`

Verify that the "media" blob storage now exists in your storage account by using the following prompt. 

`Prompt: Verify if there is a blob storage named "media" in my storage account`

## Answers to the bonus challenge
1. monitoring
2. Azure Portal, Container Console, & Azure CLI
3. Python Logging Framework: You don't currently use Python's built-in logging module which would provide more structured logs and log levels/ OpenTelemetry Integration: For more sophisticated tracing and metrics/ Explicit Exception Logging: While you catch exceptions, more detailed logging of errors would be beneficial

## Congratulations!
You started with a basic Python application that had no functionality, you deployed it to Azure and got it running, then added AI Search and AI Chat, checked the logging settings on your application and queried your storage account.

## Next
Now that you've explored the monitoring data of your application and managed your storage account, head over to [Exercise 5](/Lab-Instructions/5.exercise-cost-management.md) to learn about cost management and optimization.
