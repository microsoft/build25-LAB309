# Exercise 2: Add AI Search

> [!Note]
> Goal: Add AI search functionality to your app, add data for the search, and redeploy.

## Module overview

In [Exercise-1](/Lab-Instructions/1.exercise-deploy-app.md), you deployed a Python app to Azure Container Apps (ACA).

In this module, you are going to run `azd add` to add Azure AI Search, create an index and upload built-in sample data.

> [!NOTE] 
> Time to complete: 15 minutes

## Working with azd Compose

[azd Compose](https://aka.ms/azd-compose) is an alpha feature that allows you to progressively add Azure resources. You can run a new command called `azd add` and build up your app in a step-by-step manner as you learn.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you are still in the **/src** folder.
1. Run `azd add`
    * Select "AI".
    * Select "Azure AI Search".
    * Make sure your service uses the newly added resource by typing \<space> to select.
    ![Connect service to search](/Lab-Instructions/Images/2.ConnectServicetoSearch.png)
    * Type "Y" or simply hit \<enter> to accept changes to azure.yaml.  
1. If the **infra** folder exists, run `azd provision` to provision the newly added resource. **Note**: You see this because you have run `azd infra synth`, delete the **infra** folder and then run `azd provision` or run `azd infra synth` again to re-synthesize the infrastructure before running `azd provision`.
1. Otherwise, select `Yes` to provision the changes.
1. Provision can take about 8-10 min. 
1. While waiting, use @azure to learn more about Azure AI Search.

    Sample prompts
    * "@azure what is Azure AI Search"
    * "@azure can you explain RAG"

## Run the app locally 

1. Run the app locally to make sure everything is working. Run `azd show search` to get the environment variable to set.
1. Set your search endpoint. You'll need to replace `your-search-service-name` in the URL with your search which you got when you ran `azd show search` to get the environment variable.

####  PowerShell
```powershell
$env:AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://your-search-service-name.search.windows.net"

```
Run this command to test. If you set it correctly, you will see your Azure AI Search endpoint echoed back.

```powershell
echo $env:AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT
```

#### Bash
```bash
export AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT="https://your-search-service-name.search.windows.net"
```

Run this command to test. If you set it correctly, you will see your Azure AI Search endpoint echoed back.

```bash
echo $AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT
```
## Create index and add sample data to Azure AI Search using the app
1. Run `python app.py`
1. Click **Create Index** button to create an index.
1. Click **Upload Documents** to upload the sample hotel data.

    ![Index Management](/Lab-Instructions/Images/2.index-management.png)
1. You can now click the **Search** button. If you leave the search query empty you should get 4 results/hotels. 

**What happened and why did this work?**

* If you refer to line 32 in [app.py](/src/app.py), the Python app is using the environment variable `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` to connect to the Azure AI Search you just added. As long as you set the environment variable on your local machine, you will be able to reach the Search service.
    ```
    search_endpoint = os.environ.get('AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT')
    ```

### Shouldn't I deploy to Azure?

**You do not need to redeploy your app to Azure.**

Since you didn't change any of the app code, you **do not** need to run `azd deploy`. If you visit your service endpoint, you will see that clicking search returns all 4 hotels just like the app did when running locally.

*Hint: You can run `azd show` to get your service end point.

## The Code

At this point, your azure.yaml should look like this:

``` yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/alpha/azure.yaml.json
name: src
metadata:
  template: azd-init@xxxx
services:
  src:
    project: .
    host: containerapp
    language: python
    docker:
      path: Dockerfile
resources:
  src:
    type: host.containerapp
    port: 5000
    uses:
      - search
  search:
    type: ai.search
```

## Lab challenges

1. Can you add another hotel to the built-in sample data; deploy the app to Azure and upload document using the app running in Azure?  

**Hints**: 
* Perhaps ask your copilot where the **Upload Documents** button is getting the sample data?

  Switch Copilot to agent mode.

  Sample prompts:
  * "Can you explain to me how the hotel data is uploaded through app.py?"
  * "What if I want to add one more hotel?"

## Next
Now that you've added AI Search to your application, head over to [Exercise 3](/Lab-Instructions/3.exercise-ai-chat.md) to continue building your app and add AI Chat.
