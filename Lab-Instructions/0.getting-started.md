# Getting started

## Introduction
This lab is designed to teach you how to add AI features, like AI Search and AI Chat, to an existing application hosted on Azure while working with the GitHub Copilot for Azure extension for assistance. The lab is 75 minutes long and the exercise modules are designed to be completed in order (1, 2, 3, etc.) building up the application progressively through each exercise.

## Prerequisite
- VS Code
- GitHub Copilot Chat extension
- GitHub Copilot for Azure extension
- GitHub Copilot License
- Azure Account
- Azure Developer CLI
- Docker Desktop

## Prerequisite Knowledge 
We assume you know the basics of creating and editing files in Visual Studio Code. VS Code isn't very different from other code editors, but if you have never used any code editor you might need a little help. To learn more about VS Code, visit [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).

### Environment setup
To manually set up the environment without the script, follow the steps below:

<details>
  <summary>Manual setup instructions</summary>

  ### Step 1: Update azd and VS Code
  Run the following command in PowerShell or Bash:

  ```powershell
  winget upgrade microsoft.azd microsoft.visualstudiocode
  ```

  If you do not have azd or VS Code installed, run the following instead:
  ```powershell
  winget install microsoft.azd microsoft.visualstudiocode
  ```

  ### Step 2: Update VS Code extensions
  Run:

  ```powershell
  code --update-extensions
  ```

  ### Step 3: Start Docker Desktop
  1. Click Docker Desktop icon in Taskbar:

      <img src="..\img\docker-taskbar.png" alt="Docker in Taskbar" style="max-width: 75%; height: auto;">

  2. Make sure Docker is running

      <img src="..\img\docker-running.png" alt="Docker running" style="max-width: 75%; height: auto;">

  ### Step 4: Clone the lab repository and open in VS Code
  Run the following commands in the terminal:

  * Clone the repository
      ```powershell
      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/build25-LAB309.git
      ```

  * Open in VS Code
      ```powershell
      code build25-LAB309
      ```

  ### Step 5: Create Python virtual environment
  1. In a VS Code terminal, create a virtual environment:

     ```powershell
     cd src && python -m venv .venv
     ```

  2. Activate the virtual environment:

     - PowerShell:
       ```powershell
       .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
       ```
     - Bash:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```

  3. Install required Python packages:

     ```powershell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Authenticate to GitHub

1. In a browser, navigate to [https://github.com](https://github.com).

2. Enter your GitHub username and password. 

## Authenticate to Azure

### Authenticate with az (Azure CLI)
1. Open a Windows terminal, run:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

2. Enter your Azure Portal username and password.

3. Press \<enter> to select the default subscription and tenant when prompted.

4. Register the Microsoft.CognitiveServices resource provider:

    ```bash
    az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
    ```

### Authenticate with azd (Azure Developer CLI)
1. Open a Windows terminal, run:

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```
2. Use the same Azure Portal credentials.

## Run app locally
  1. Open a new terminal in VS Code.
  2. Navigate to the `src` directory:

     ```powershell
     cd src
     ```
  3. Activate the virtual environment:

     - PowerShell:
       ```powershell
       .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
       ```
     - Bash:
       ```bash
       source .venv/Scripts/activate
       ```
  4. Run the app:

      ```powershell
      python app.py
      ```

  Congratulations! You now have your app running locally.

  > [!NOTE]
  > None of the buttons work, but that's expected at this point. We're going to fix those in the exercises.

  Press `Ctrl+C` in the Terminal to stop the app.

You are now ready to start. Please continue with [Exercise 1](/Lab-Instructions/1.exercise-deploy-app.md).
