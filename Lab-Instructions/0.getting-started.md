# Getting started

## Welcome Microsoft Build attendees
The instructions on this page are for Microsoft Build 2025 attendees of Lab 309. This assumes you have access to the pre-configured lab environment, which provides an Azure subscription and all the tools you need to complete the workshop.

## Introduction
This workshop is designed to teach you how to add AI features, like AI Search and AI Chat, to an existing application while working with the GitHub Copilot for Azure agent for assistance. The lab exercise modules are designed to be completed in order (1, 2, 3, etc.) building up the application progressively through each exercise.

## Logistics
The lab is 75 minutes. There are two presenters and four proctors, so you will have support throughout the lab. If you need help, please raise your hand and a proctor will explain how to complete these tasks. We're here to help!

## Prerequisite Knowledge 
We assume you know the basics of creating and editing files in Visual Studio Code. VS Code isn't very different from other code editors, but if you have never used any code editor you might need a little help.

## Locate your Azure Subscription information
Navigate to `Resources` in your Skillable VM to locate the `username` and `password` for logging into the Azure account.

## Prepare dev environment
In the lab environment, the `lab-setup.ps1` script has already been run for you. This means:

1. **VS Code should already open** with the lab repo loaded.
2. **Docker Desktop should be running.**
3. **All required tools and extensions should be up to date.**

Proceed directly to [Set up Python environment](#Set-up-Python-environment) below.

If you're on the lab machine and don't see VS Code open with the lab project or Docker isn't running, double-click the `lab-setup` script located on the desktop and wait for the script to finish (2-3 minutes):

> [!NOTE]
> If running on your own machine (not the provided lab environment):
> - Windows users: Run the [`lab-setup.ps1`](../lab-setup.ps1) script from the repo
> - Others: Follow the [Manual setup](#manual-setup) instructions below

### Manual setup
To manually set up the environment, follow the steps below:

<details>
  <summary>Manual setup instructions</summary>

  ### Step 1: Update azd and VS Code
  Run the following command in PowerShell or Bash:

  ```powershell
  winget upgrade microsoft.azd microsoft.visualstudiocode
  ```

  If you do not have azd or VS Code installed, run the following instead:
  ```powershell
  winget install microsoft.azd microsoft.visualstudiocode
  ```

  ### Step 2: Update VS Code extensions
  Run:

  ```powershell
  code --update-extensions
  ```

  ### Step 3: Start Docker Desktop
  1. Click Docker Desktop icon in Taskbar:

  2. Make sure Docker is running

  ### Step 4: Clone the lab repository and open in VS Code
  Run the following commands in the terminal:

  * Clone the repository
      ```powershell
      git clone https://github.com/microsoft/build25-LAB309.git
      ```

  * Open in VS Code
      ```powershell
      code build25-LAB309
      ```
</details>

## Run app locally
  1. Open a new terminal in VS Code.
  2. Navigate to the `src` directory:

     ```powershell
     cd src
     ```

  3. Create a virtual environment:

     ```powershell
     python -m venv .venv
     ```

  4. Activate the virtual environment:

     - PowerShell:
       ```powershell
       .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
       ```
     - Bash:
       ```bash
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```

  5. Install required Python packages:

     ```powershell
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

  6. Run the app:

      ```powershell
      python app.py
      ```

  Congratulations! You now have your app running locally.

  > [!NOTE]
  > None of the buttons work, but that's expected at this point. We're going to fix those in the exercises.

  Press `Ctrl+C` in the Terminal to stop the app.

You are now ready to start. Please continue with [Exercise 1](/Lab-Instructions/1.Exercise-1.md).
