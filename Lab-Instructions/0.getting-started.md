# Getting started

## Welcome Microsoft Build attendees
The instructions on this page are for Microsoft Build 2025 attendees of Lab 309. This assumes you have access to the pre-configured lab environment, which provides an Azure subscription and all the tools you need to complete the workshop.

## Introduction
This workshop is designed to teach you how to add AI features, like AI Search and AI Chat, to an existing application while working with the GitHub Copilot for Azure agent for assistance. The lab exercise modules are designed to be completed in order (1, 2, 3, etc.) building up the application progressively through each exercise.

## Logistics
The lab is 75 minutes. There are two presenters and four proctors, so you will have support throughout the lab. If you need help, please raise your hand and a proctor will explain how to compete these tasks. We're here to help!

## Prerequisite Knowledge 
We assume you know the basics of creating and editing files in Visual Studio Code. VS Code isn't very different from other code editors, but if you have never used any code editor you might need a little help.

## Locate your Azure Subscription information
Navigate to `Resources` in your Skillable VM to locate the `username` and `password` for logging into the Azure account.

## Authenticate with azd (Azure Developer CLI)
Open a Windows terminal, run:

```bash
azd auth login
```
Supply the Azure Portal username and password identified in previous step. 

## Get the latest Azure Developer CLI (azd) build & VS Code
Before we get started, let's make sure we have the latest version of azd and Visual Studio Code. Run this command in PowerShell or Bash.

```powershell
winget upgrade microsoft.azd microsoft.visualstudiocode
```

## Make sure Docker Desktop is running
1. Click Docker Desktop icon in Taskbar:

## Get started with the repo
In this lab, we will start by cloning the lab repository.

1. From the terminal
    * Clone the repository
        ```powershell
        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/build25-LAB309.git
        ```
    * Change to the cloned repo directory
        ```powershell
        cd build25-LAB309
        ```
    * Open in VS Code
        ```powershell
        code .
        ```

2. In VS Code (open a new terminal)

    Open a new Termnial (select PowerShell or Bash depending on preference)

* Change to the src directory

    Powershell/Bash

    ```powershell
    cd src
    ```
    
* Create virtual environment

    PowerShell/Bash
    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
* Activate virtual environment
    
    PowerShell
    ```powershell
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
    Bash
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

* Install required Python packages
    PowerShell/Bash
    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Run the app

    ```powershell
    python app.py
    ```
   
Congratulations! You now have your app running locally.
    
> Note:
> None of the buttons work, but that's expected at this point. We're going to fix those in the exercises.

Press `ctrl+c` in the Terminal to stop the app.
