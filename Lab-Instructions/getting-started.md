# Getting started

## Welcome Microsoft Build attendees
The instructions on this page are for Microsoft Build 2025 attendees of Lab309. This assumes you have access to the pre-configured lab environment, which provides an Azure subscription and all the tools you need to complete the workshop.

## Introduction
This workshop is designed to teach you how to build an application with AI Search and AI Chat model working with the GitHub Copilot for Azure agent. The lab exercise modules are designed to be completed in order 1 through 4 building up the application progressively through each exercise.

## Logistics
The lab is 75 minutes. There are two presenters and four proctors, so you will have support throughout the lab.

## Prerequisite Knowledge 
We assume you know the basics of creating and editing files in Visual Studio Code. VS code isn't very different from other code editors, but if you have never used any code editor you might need a little help. If you need help, please raise your hand and a proctor will explain how to compete these tasks. Thanks!

## Authenticate with Azure
Navigate to **Resources** in your Skillable VM to locate the user id and password for logging into your Azure account.
