# Exercise 1: Get started with AI app development

> [!Note]
> Goal: Deploy your application to Azure.

## Module overview

In this lab module, you learn about working with the Azure Developer CLI (azd), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and preparing to add AI features to your sample hotel search app.

You ran the Python app locally in [Getting Started](0.getting-started.md). In this module, you are going to run `azd init` and `azd up` to deploy the app to Azure Container Apps (ACA).

Once you complete this exercise, you will have your application deployed to Azure and ready to add AI features.

> Time to complete: 15 minutes

## Working with the Azure Developer CLI (azd)

[Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/azd) is an open-source command line tool that provides high-level, developer-friendly commands that can help you build, deploy, and manage your application on Azure. 

## Instructions
1. In a VS Code terminal, make sure you are in the **/src** directory. 
1. Run `azd config set alpha.compose on` to enable the feature since azd Compose is an alpha feature.
1. Run `azd init` to initialize the project.
    * Select "Use code in the current directory".
    * Select "Confirm and continue initializing my app".

    What happened?
    * An azure.yaml file is added in the **/src** directory.
    * A **next-steps.md** file is also generated.

1. Run `azd up` to deploy the app to Azure.
    * Provide **test** as the the environment name. It's critical that you set the environment name as **test** for this exercise. 
    * Select the provided subscription.
    * Provide a location, please use **East US 2**.

1. Provision can take 8-10 minutes. 

1. While waiting, use GitHub Copilot for Azure
    * Locate and click the GitHub Copilot icon in the top command bar to open the chat pane.
    ![open copilot](/Lab-Instructions/Images/1.open-github-copilot-chat.png)
    * When prompted to sign in, use the GitHub Enterprise Username and Password found in the **Instructions** tab within the Skillable VM.

    Sample prompts for **Ask mode**:
    * "**@azure** what is Azure Container App?"
    * "**@azure** what are some alternatives for deploying a container to Azure?"
    * "**@azure** tell me more about ..."
    * "**@azure** what does this repo do?"
    * "**@azure** why is this using azd?"
    * "**@azure** what is azd add?"
    * "**@azure** what regions is Azure OpenAI available in?"
    * "**@azure** what are the different variants available for gpt-4o"
    * "**@azure** what are azd templates?"
    * "**@azure** are there azd templates for Azure AISearch?"

1. Once provision and deployment is complete, click the endpoint to check out the app running on Azure.

## The Code

At this point, your azure.yaml should look like this:

``` yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/alpha/azure.yaml.json

name: src
metadata:
    template: azd-init@xxxx
services:
    src:
        project: .
        host: containerapp
        language: python
        docker:
            path: Dockerfile
resources:
    src:
        type: host.containerapp
        port: 5000
```

## Lab challenges
azd Compose uses Bicep. All IaC files are generated in memory.

To get the Bicep code:
* Run `azd config set alpha.infraSynth on` to enable the feature (infraSynth is also an alpha feature.)
* Run `azd infra synth` to get the /infra folder and all Bicep files generated under /infra.

> [!NOTE]
> If you run `azd infra synth`, make sure you delete the /infra folder before you proceed with subsequent exercise. Otherwise, every time you add a new resource using `azd add`, you need to run `azd infra synth` to regenerate the Bicep code written on disk.

Questions:
1. Can you tell us if zone redundancy is enabled for the Azure Container app?
1. In **azure.yaml**, can you explain how `azd` know to open port 5000 on the Azure Container App?

**Hints**: 
* azd Compose uses [Azure Verified Module (AVM)](https://aka.ms/AVM). With Bicep VS Code extension, you can mouse-over a module.

    ![Mouse over module name](/Lab-Instructions/Images/1.mouse-over-avm.png)
    
    or hit F12 to learn more about the AVM module azd is referencing.
* Or, you can just ask GitHub Copilot to find the answer for you!

    Sample prompt:
    * "@azure my Bicep files are in /infra, can you tell me if zone redundancy is enabled for my container app?"

## Next

Now that you've got your application deployed to Azure, head over to [Exercise 2](/Lab-Instructions/2.exercise-ai-search.md) to continue building your application and adding AI functionality.
